    <p>I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Cincinnati, working with Dr. Yujie Sun. My research focuses on the design and synthesis of photoactive transition metal complexes for biomedical applications, particularly photodynamic therapy (PDT).</p>
    <p>I completed my Ph.D. in 2025 at the University of Alabama under the supervision of Dr. Wenfang Sun, where I developed visible and NIR-absorbing Iridium/Ruthenium/Osmium photosensitizers. I have additional research experience in Hong Kong, China, and North Dakota, with expertise in organic synthesis, photophysics, and biomedical chemistry.</p>
